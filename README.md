# mid-term-project

# DAY 1: 19/09/22

- Add html of the 3 pages
- Add images on all pages
- Add forms (html5 validation)
- Create general function to fetch content for the projects section: with parameters to change the posts called in each page.

---- Main difficulty
Find the way (not founded today) to retrieve a return from a fetch.then() to use this in an inline script to trigger the function differently depending on the page. But founded an easy way to solve the problem (adding a parameter to the main function).
