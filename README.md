# mid-term-project

## DAY 1: 19/09/22

- Add html of the 3 pages
- Add images on all pages
- Add forms (html5 validation)
- Create general function to fetch content for the projects section: with parameters to change the posts called in each page.

---- Main difficulty

- Find the way (not founded today) to retrieve a return from a fetch.then() to use this in an inline script to trigger the function differently depending on the page. But founded an easy way to solve the problem (adding a parameter to the main function).

## DAY 2: 20/09/22

- Finished calling content inside cards on home and project page
- Added a function to call the specific content of 1 post on each project page.
- Start adding styles on stylesheet

---- Main difficulty

- Tried to create a function to add the active class on the menu depending on the page (but didn't find a convincing way to do it). I think I'll do it taking into consideration the url-
- Tried to "automattically" generate project pages using the project.html as a template, but didn't find a convincing way to do it neither. And I don't like the solution of creating every html for every project but... I think I'll do this.

## DAY 3: 21/09/22

- Basically, working all day to add the css styles of the Home page and the project page. Just have left the contact page, and some responsive styles/behaviour, like the hamburger menu.

## DAY 4: 22/09/22

- Added the hamburger menu, with css and javascript.
- Finished adding responsive styles from the contact page.
- Finished the styles of the project page

---- Main difficulty

- Tried to create the blur effect/shadow of the project image, but didn't find a convincing solution, as I wanted to have the image inside a limited div (with overflow hidden) and couldn't achieve the desired result. I finally left it.
